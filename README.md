# sudokuSolver
In this python project, I have created a sudoku solver which takes an unsolved sudoku board and returns the solved board. It uses various functions that work together to check for things like printing the board itself, checking if a cell is empty and checking if a number placement is valid. This solution uses the method of backtracking.
